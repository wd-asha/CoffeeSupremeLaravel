                <p>Better coffee for all is a constant. It's matter of doing things better than the time before and ensuring it's a better experience for all involved</p>
                <p>Sustainability in sourcing coffee is formed through building long term relationships with the people we know and trust, where each can rely on the other</p>

            <div class="post-text2-purpose">
                <p>We prioritise quality and taste to create better coffee experiences for our customers. We always ask, ‘what can we do better?’ And because we’ve done this for the past three decades, you can trust we’ll keep asking ourselves this question. A Supreme cup of coffee is one you can trust, for flavour and care</p>
                <p>Better is a constant, we’re always improving — we’re better than the time before. It’s better for everyone who’s come to the party: coffee producers, coffee makers and coffee drinkers. Better coffee is about taste and quality. It’s about looking after the environment, looking after each other, and it means choosing a coffee you can trust.</p>

            <div class="post-text1-purpose">
                <p>We take care to buy the good stuff, it’s expensive, but it’s worth it. It’s a fair deal — we get good green coffee, producers get good money and you get to drink the best coffee in town. It’s important to us to know where our coffee comes from, the people, the farms, the regions</p>
                <p>Ultimately, the flavour of our coffee is directly linked to the quality of green coffee we begin with. It’s always been important to us to source first and foremost, delicious coffee of supreme quality. Securing the coffee we enjoy requires a lot of hard work — it’s not as simple popping an order in with a warehouse across town. It necessitates months of planning and logistics to ensure we can get what we’re after, all the way to our neck of the woods.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="post-text2-purpose">
                <p>The key to this is the trust and confidence we share with the producers we work with. They know what we are after and they know we’ll pay top dollar for it. Sustainability in sourcing coffee is formed through  building long term relationships with the people we know and trust, where each can rely on the other. These are relationships we are proud of, and ones that are critical to our business</p>
                <p>Sourcing coffee with this amount of care means our team is busy throughout the year communicating with producers, visiting directly with them at their farm, mill or tasting lab to taste what’s good, and share good coffee together. We put in the hard yards to secure Supreme coffee, but it's worth it</p>

                <p>A solid example of this, is the Mierisch family. We've been purchasing coffee from Fincas Mierisch for 10 years, with annual visits marked on our calendars. The farm's been around for years and produces some of the world's best coffee. Well, we think so anyway</p>

                <p>While the roasting process might seem like a lot of heat and big bits of spinning steel, it’s actually a very delicate and precise operation that takes dedication and skill to do well. We see it as our duty to ensure that the hard work already invested in the coffee is preserved and celebrated in every cup - every coffee has a story and we strive to tell that story on behalf of its maker</p>

                <p>This is the pointy end of coffee and it’s a delicious place to find yourself. The world of specialty coffee opens the door to more complex flavour profiles, stories and knowledge, if that’s your thing. Coffee, just like good ingredients at a restaurant, is truly seasonal and seasonality brings variety. As well as perfecting our regular coffees, our coffee menu looks to celebrate this seasonality and diversity. After all, coffee is a fruit, and fruit tastes best when it’s fresh</p>
